{"description":"Neurotrophins are a family of trophic factors involved in differentiation and survival of neural cells. The neurotrophin family consists of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin 4 (NT-4). Neurotrophins exert their functions through engagement of Trk tyrosine kinase receptors or p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Neurotrophin/Trk signaling is regulated by connecting a variety of intracellular signaling cascades, which include MAPK pathway, PI-3 kinase pathway, and PLC pathway, transmitting positive signals like enhanced survival and growth. On the other hand, p75NTR transmits both positive and nagative signals. These signals play an important role for neural development and additional higher-order activities such as learning and memory.","genes":["RPS6KA5","MAP3K1","MAP3K3","GAB1","MAP3K5","FRS2","FOXO3","RPS6KA6","NTF3","NTF4","MAGED1","SHC3","CALML6","SORT1","SHC4","IRS4","MAPK14","SOS1","SOS2","RPS6KA4","MAPK12","RIPK2","MAPK1","MAPK3","MAPK7","MAPK8","PIK3R3","PSEN1","PSEN2","TP53","PLCG1","RELA","PLCG2","YWHAE","YWHAG","YWHAH","YWHAZ","RHOA","MAPK11","MAPK9","MAPK10","BAX","MAPK13","MAP2K1","MAP2K2","MAP2K5","MAP2K7","BRAF","IRAK1","IRAK2","JUN","NFKB1","NFKBIA","ABL1","NFKBIB","NFKBIE","YWHAQ","AKT3","CALML3","CAMK4","CAMK2A","CAMK2B","CAMK2D","GRB2","CAMK2G","RAPGEF1","MAPKAPK2",null,"GSK3B","NTRK1","NTRK2","NGF","NTRK3","NGFR","NGFRAP1","IRAK3","RPS6KA1","RPS6KA2","RPS6KA3","PRDM4","CRK","CRKL","SHC1","CSK","PIK3CA","PIK3CB","PIK3CD","IRS2","PIK3CG","PIK3R1","PIK3R2","PDK1","PRKCD","TRAF6","RAF1","PTPN11","TP73","RAC1","ARHGDIA","ARHGDIB","HRAS","BCL2","PIK3R5","YWHAB","BAD","SH2B1","IKBKB","ATF4","FASLG","IRS1","RAP1A","CDC42","RAP1B","SHC2","IRAK4","KRAS","ZNF274","AKT1","AKT2","BDNF","NRAS","SH2B3","CALM1",null,"CALM3","CALML5","KIDINS220"],"name":"Neurotrophin signaling pathway"}
